### Notes

This package uses `deasync` which is a controversial package to use in production environments.

There are plenty of articles out there that provide extensive reasons not to use it. I definitely recommend reading [this article](https://joecreager.com/5-reasons-to-avoid-deasync-for-node-js/) first.

Use `react-async-state` in production environments at your own risk. It is only being used here as a quick way to solve a complex problem.
